# Trivial-Time

High school final project.

Digital version of the popular board game Trivial Pursuit. Developed with Visual Basic and WPF.

This was developed by a chronic procrastinator with tight deadlines, expect rushed code.

Database files can be found in the repo, make sure to change the connection string.
